404 is a response status code in HTTP that indicates that there's no resource at the requested address. The resource being a webpage, a media attachment, an API data object or whatever else is distributed over HTTP.

There's a number of things that could **generally** lead you to a page like this:

- You purposely edited the URL to see what the website's 404 page is, or maybe just for fun
- The page was indeed available at one point, but was later removed by the editors of the website for whatever reason
- The link you saw (or otherwise perceived) elsewhere had a typo in it or somehow got damaged on its way to your browser
  - I really wish people used QR codes whenever they publish a link outside of the digital world — typing out the address is very tedious and error-prone

Due to how common these pages are on the World Wide Web, this status code in particular is probably the most widely known, reaching well outside the circles of technology enthusiasts.

> **🌟 _And_ I reuse this note about 404s as a 404 error page. Neat, right?**

I just started writing down a proper 404 page with recommendations, but then I realized a lot of them apply not just to this website, but to _any_ website.

So I decided to write a note about it and reuse it as an error page.

This is that note.

💭 And yes, I do on occasion delete pages here. This isn't a blog, it's [[Digital garden|a garden]]. My vision for the garden doesn't involve hoarding history records. This happens in sufficiently many places already. I try to focus on key takeaways in the present day.

⁉ Now, if you _didn't mean_ to end up here, here's what you can do:

- **[🗺 Check the map](/map)** to see if I covered any associated subjects here
- **[📝 Let me know](https://dside.ru/en/)** if you believe what you were looking for <em>should</em> be here
- **[🏠 Check the homepage](/)** out of curiosity if you've got some time to spare
