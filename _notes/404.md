404 is a response status code in HTTP that indicates that there's no resource at the requested address. The resource being a page, a media attachment or whatever else is distributed over HTTP.

There's a number of things that could **generally** lead you to a page like this:

- You purposely edited the URL to see what the website's 404 page is, or maybe just for fun
- The page was indeed available at one point, but was later removed by the editors of the website
- The link you saw (or otherwise perceived) elsewhere had a typo in it or somehow got damaged on its way to your browser
  - I really wish people used QR codes whenever they publish a link outside of the digital world — typing out the address is very tedious and error-prone
