> "Be the change you want to see in the world"

A quote [questionably](https://medium.com/illumination-curated/gandhi-didnt-actually-ever-say-be-the-change-you-want-to-see-in-the-world-d65b92cf5db) attributed to Mahatma Gandhi, is a very sound piece of advice, it encourages testing of your own views on how the world should be, somewhat substantiating their validity over time.
