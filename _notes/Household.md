I sometimes get compliments about how modern my household is. It's still a mess, but I'd like to think that it would be even more of a mess if it wasn't for modern technology, especially since I'm managing the whole thing on my own. And it's not just about my [[home automation|smart home]], there's a lot of uncommon "dumb hardware" that is either too recent for widespread use or historically underappreciated for some reason.

_[[TODO]] From a list of rather raw ideas make something more usable, illustrative and informative_

## General

* Mobility for everything
  * What isn't mobile, can be made mobile temporarily through the use of a lever and platforms on wheels, these can be found at decent prices
* Smaller apartments call for smaller solutions
  * My short history with vacuum cleaners:
      * I got one I've had good experience with, ended up barely using it, because while it's good, it's also pretty high-maintenance because it has a water-based filter which has to be cleaned after every use, and it's also rather bulky and needs a mains cord to function
      * I got another vacuum cleaner, battery-powered with a cyclone filter which has none of these flaws: it happily endures being left mid-cleanup, is very small and doesn't have a cord â€” as a result of all that I tend to use it a lot more often
* Cleaning kit
* Useful and useless sides of IKEA
  * What's simple is probably also flexible
  * Furniture in standard sizes can only pack things so tight, tighter spaces are better served by custom-built pieces; however, tighter spaces can be altered slightly to make them adhere to more standard sizes, but a plan for that has to be made before the space has finished walls, floor or ceiling

## Entrance

* Pegboard-based coat rack

## Organization

* Label printer, one of my best self-organization purchases
* Cheat sheets (e. g. clothing symbols on the washing machine)
* NFC stickers
* Adhesive whiteboard film _[[TODO]] (I've yet to actually apply it)_
* Use a mindset of making it understandable to somebody else; because after long enough you **will** be somebody else
  * "The next guy to take over could be **you**. Two years older. Or two days older and you've forgotten what's going on" â€” ["Types are like the Weather, Type Systems are like Weathermen" by Matthias Felleisen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTl7Jn_kmio); while he was talking about software, the meaning isn't limited to it.

## Kitchen

Because a lot of the time I cook fresh meals for myself, I have quite a bit of hardware to make the boring parts easier.

* Microwave oven
  * Plastic microwave steamer is surprisingly versatile
* Mandoline slicer, for veggies
* Magnets for the fridge, function over form
* What's with the trash bin under the sink?
* Pepper grinders are good for more than just pepper: salt, sugar, coriander, etc.
* Plenty of food-safe silicone utilities that don't damage soft surfaces or fold nicely, like funnels, drinking glasses, stainers, spatulas, etc.

Hard learned lessons:

* You do **not** need a big drying rack for the dishes if you have a dishwasher, just those and means of **storage**
* Cooking fresh meals **every single day** eventually gets old, but at that point it may be a habit that's hard to get rid of that'll wear you down ([[Mental health]])
    * Several solutions:
        * Batch your cooking to yield multiple meals per session, as long as remaining portions can be properly preserved and there are means to heat the food back up (microwave works best most of the time)
        * Use a meal delivery service, if there is one in your area at a reasonable price (they're often aimed at body builders, so prices can be exorbitant)
        * Find someone to share meals and cooking duties with

## Living room

Which also in my case doubles as a bedroom and an office, so advice listed in thsi section may be mixed

* ~~LCD+solar thermometer~~
  * Looks cool throughout the day, but useless in the dark
  * Double-sided tape needs replacement every once in a while, mine failed and took the device with it during a window wash
* Ultrasonic humidifier aka "reusable and customizable scented candle"
  * Can add to festive moods, e. g. on New Year's Eve I use a combination of tangerine oil with something evergreen ðŸŒ² like pine or juniper
* More pegboards

## Bedroom

* I don't buy small bedding sets, because this way I can use the same sets interchangably both for my own bed (for 1 person) and the couch (for 2 people); the same goes for blankets.
  * Not for sheets though, as I use _fitted sheets_ (that enclose the mattress from all sides but the bottom using either elastic band or a drawstring), that are tailored for certain mattress sizes. So I still have to keep two sheets per bedding set. But it's still a win, since I can use any set on any bed with minimal extra expenses.

## Bathroom

* DIY shower cabin

## Outside

* I used to have a couple folding beach chairs. But I've never found them to be easy to transport, and as such only used them once or twice. I could pretty much only lug them to a local park on foot, because it's too big for almost everything else, including most cars, planes, trains and even my bike.
  * I've bought a cheap variation of a "Lamzac" or, as it is better known in Russia due to aggressive marketing, "Ð‘Ð¸Ð²Ð°Ð½" (Bivan) â€” a type of an inflatable "couch" that is prepped for duty by flailing it around to fill with non-pressurized air, then closing the bags up and tightening them up until there is enough pressure inside to use the thing. It's orders of magnitude more pocketable, and therefore usable in a lot more scenarios.

## Missing pieces

* External means of storage (?)
  * I have heard that some cities have warehouses that can store rarely used stuff outside of the apartment, allowing to make better use of apartment space. Apartments in Russia usually include storage spaces in areas that are otherwise useless, but these places are usually very hard to access and offer very limited space.
  * After revising my possessions I'm actually close to concluding that I can free up enough space at my current place to not need this. Still, it's something that will make a city a lot more comfortable for the general public.
