I sometimes get compliments about how modern my household is. It's still a mess, but I'd like to think that it would be even more of a mess if it wasn't for modern technology, especially since I'm managing the whole thing on my own. And it's not just about my [[home automation|smart home]], there's a lot of uncommon "dumb hardware" that is either recent or historically underappreciated.

_[[TODO]] From a list of rather raw ideas make something more usable, illustrative and informative_

## General

* Mobility for everything
* Smaller apartments call for smaller solutions
* Cleaning kit
* Usefulness of IKEA

## Entrance

* Pegboard-based wardrobe

## Organization

* Label printer
* Cheat sheets (e. g. clothing symbols on the washing machine)
* NFC stickers
* Adhesive whiteboard film _[[TODO]] (I've yet to actually apply it)_

## Kitchen

Because a lot of the time I cook fresh meals for myself, I have quite a bit of hardware to make the boring parts easier.

* Microwave oven
  * Plastic microwave steamer is surprisingly versatile
* Mandoline slicer, for veggies
* Magnets for the fridge, function over form
* What's with the trash bin under the sink?

## Living room

* LCD+solar thermometer
* Ultrasonic humidifier aka reusable and customizable scented candle
* More pegboards

## Bathroom

* DIY shower cabin
