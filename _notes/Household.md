I sometimes get compliments about how modern my household is. It's still a mess, but I'd like to think that it would be even more of a mess if it wasn't for modern technology, especially since I'm managing the whole thing on my own. And it's not just about my [[home automation|smart home]], there's a lot of uncommon "dumb hardware" that is either too recent for widespread use or historically underappreciated for some reason.

_[[TODO]] From a list of rather raw ideas make something more usable, illustrative and informative_

## General

* Mobility for everything
* Smaller apartments call for smaller solutions
  * My history with vacuum cleaners
* Cleaning kit
* Usefulness of IKEA

## Entrance

* Pegboard-based wardrobe

## Organization

* Label printer, one of my best self-organization purchases
* Cheat sheets (e. g. clothing symbols on the washing machine)
* NFC stickers
* Adhesive whiteboard film _[[TODO]] (I've yet to actually apply it)_

## Kitchen

Because a lot of the time I cook fresh meals for myself, I have quite a bit of hardware to make the boring parts easier.

* Microwave oven
  * Plastic microwave steamer is surprisingly versatile
* Mandoline slicer, for veggies
* Magnets for the fridge, function over form
* What's with the trash bin under the sink?

## Living room

* LCD+solar thermometer
  * Looks cool throughout the day, but useless in the dark
* Ultrasonic humidifier aka "reusable and customizable scented candle"
  * Can add to festive moods, e. g. on New Year's Eve I use a combination of tangerine oil with something evergreen ðŸŒ² like pine or juniper
* More pegboards

## Bedroom

* I don't buy small bedding sets, because this way I can use the same sets interchangably both for my own bed (for 1 person) and the couch (for 2 people); the same goes for blankets.
  * Not for sheets though, as I use _fitted sheets_ (that enclose the mattress from all sides but the bottom using either elastic band or a drawstring), that are tailored for certain mattress sizes. So I still have to keep two sheets per bedding set. But it's still a win, since I can use any set on any bed with minimal extra expenses.

## Bathroom

* DIY shower cabin

## Missing pieces

* External means of storage
  * I have heard that some cities have warehouses that can store rarely used stuff outside of the apartment, allowing to make better use of apartment space. Apartments in Russia usually include storage spaces in areas that are otherwise useless, but these places are usually very hard to access and offer very limited space.
