People have grown accustomed to using general-purpose web search engines for finding whatever it is they need to find. While serviceable, this approach involuntarily opts you into participation in their business and research, which relies on its opt-out nature, and opting out is notoriously difficult.

Some other sources to look at:

* Projects of Wikimedia Foundation, most notably Wikipedia – while the quality of information there can often be questionable, especially in non-English ones, it usually works out when looking for an overview " in layman's terms" and includes references for further lookups
* `awesome` repositoritories on GitHub collect various sources on a number of topics, usually technical; searching GitHub for `awesome-$TOPIC` (e. g. `awesome-git`) usually yields useful results
* Linux command line utilities often come with a manual commonly accessible via `man $COMMAND`, `$COMMAND --help` or `$COMMAND help`. Some utilities have more obscure ways, but these are generally discouraged.
* Arch Wiki is a wealth of information on most Linix-related topics, and not just about Arch. In contrast with manpages, which are often but a reference manual, it usually outlines more practical information like common uses and issues.
* Again on the problem of manpages often being a dry list of all options – utilities like `cheat` and `tldr` provide common uses of many utilities in form of complete commands.
* **Zeal** is a documentation browser, supposedly inspired by Dash, thar allows you to browse many documentation websites offline at full speed, at the expense of some disk space, although with modern disks this is hardly a huge concern.
