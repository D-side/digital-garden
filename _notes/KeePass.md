title: KeePass
---

KeePass is a piece of software for password management, which is not very interesting by itself, but its successors *very much* are. It can handle passwords, two-factor authentication, SSH keys, file attachments and pretty much any data where you only want to access one individual entry at a time.

*TODO: list particular implementations and uses; describe the SSH agent and idiosyncrasies around it and WSL2.*
