# Power Delivery

A charging standard for devices with USB Type C ports, notable for supporting multiple voltages (5V to 48V as of 2022) and thanks to that capable of charging more types of devices.

Random notes from a user's perspective:

* Compatibility mostly comes down to supported **voltages**.
	* Marketing materials confusingly use wattages a lot of the time. But something like 45W can be provided both in 12V and 20V, a laptop might very well expect 20V and otherwise refuse to charge. Lower wattage, however, will still allow charging, but at a lower rate.
* Some of the cheaper/shoddier devices cannot be charged over double-ended-Type-C cables due to PD specification violations; Type-Aâ€”Type-C cables can be used in these cases instead.
