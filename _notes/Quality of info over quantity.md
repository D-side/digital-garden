If anything, the internet has showed us that there's more information than a single human mind can usefully comprehend. Some say "there's no limit to what a human mind can achieve", but more often than not that statement is meant to motivate rather than state something. And in my experience, packing a mind with information on its own isn't a very useful activity.

I place my goalpost at the ability to do something useful, so I'd like knowledge I post to be findable, legible and **explorable up to arbitrary depth**. The last bit is especially important because different people have different goals in mind and I don't want to waste any more of their time than I absolutely have to.
