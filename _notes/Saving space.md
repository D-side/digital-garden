[[Household]]

* There are foldable silicone buckets and basins that fold practically flat, making them ridiculously easy to store when not in use
* Prefer rectangular shapes in any tight spaces, since other shapes very often incur a waste of space near themselves: round jars on shelves and a round trash bin in a tight kitchen will waste space wherever objects are close to each other
    * This is not that big a concern for smaller objects, which may also be difficult to find in rectangular shapes, like pepper grinders and smaller jars
