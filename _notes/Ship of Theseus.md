A philosophical problem about the nature of identity that describes a ship and questions whether it remains the same ship even after all parts of it have been replaced, leaving nothing of the original.

The intuitive answer to the problem tends to be "yes", but attempts to produce an explanation lead you into trying to define a highly abstract concept of identity. Which might not go well at all, might confirm "yes" as an answer or change it to "no". It's an interesting brain teaser.

I don't think there is a right answer to this question, and an answer not really the point of it. The value of it lies in the follow-up questions and observation of the thought processes involved.

## Organizations

If an organization has a change in leadership, changes strategy, replaces some of its management and assigns other kinds of work to its employees, is it still the same organization?

It certainly keeps the *name*, which to the public eye might look like nothing's changed.
