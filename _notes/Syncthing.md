Syncthing is a very decent solution to synchronization that does not require you to have a server to operate. But unlike most "cloud storage" services that store your data (and may read it "for analytics and ad targeting") and keep pushing you into purchasing more space, Syncthing's servers are only responsible for establishing **communication** between your devices, allowing you to use however much space you have.
