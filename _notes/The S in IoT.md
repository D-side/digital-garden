# The S in IoT

There is a famous joke about there being no S (=Security) in IoT (internet of things).

Sadly, there is a lot of truth to this claim: to make the setup easier for end-users, most vendors mandate the use of solutions controlled by themselves or their partners.

This isn't a big deal for low-risk applications, but as users get comfortable with this approach, the "acceptable risk" bar gets higher because lower risk devices haven't caused any issues so far. Sadly, for an individual that does not make that any less of a problem.
