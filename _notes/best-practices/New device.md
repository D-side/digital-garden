When you've purchased a new device (any kind of consumer electronics, but the same applies to many other kinds of hardware too), make sure to:

- Save purchase information, including:
    - Price (people may ask about it)
        - Ideally also in USD or whichever other currency defines its cost
    - Order identifier and receipt, to make it easier to deal with faulty products
- Write down its expected warranty expiration, even better if it's a system that can tell you when it expires; many task management solutions offer a "due date" and can display it relative to current date, e. g. "in 3 months" or "tomorrow"
- Find a digital (⚠) version of its manual and save it in a central place — digital spaces are a lot easier to search than physical ones, and physical space in manuals costs more as well
    - [Grocy](https://grocy.info/) has a dedicated section for notes and attachments regarding various home appliances, but it can be used for everything you want
    - Any decent note-taking app will do as well
