title: First programming language
---

This question can come in many forms. "What programming language should I learn first?" Or "What programming language is trending at the moment?"

(NB: "programming" in there specifically cuts off a very true, but probably not a very useful answer: English.)

## Short answer

Understand **what you want to do** and instead ask what language does **that** the quickest.

## Sanity check

That's probably not what you actually want to know. It's not just a generic *"I just want to learn how to program"*.

If it is, I give you one more chance: ask yourself **why** you want to learn to program. If nothing comes up still, I actually have a very specific and short answer for you.

## **`don't`**

Because if you're learning something that doesn't have a purpose behind it, chances are you'll soon forget it and the time you spent learning was mostly _wasted_.

Not happy with this answer? Then there may be a reason behind that intention that you're just refusing to admit. In which case, read on, I might have a few hints.

## If there is a purpose

### Specific project (or type of project)

This is the easiest case to handle.

#### Specific product

Got a very particular piece of hardware or software that accepts custom programs but doesn't do *exactly* what you want? Ask around, see how to get started with that particular thing. In such a specific area there is usually *one* preferred language, and the community around whatever it is will usually point you to it.

#### Video game

Got a video game idea? Ok, [this can get tough easily](https://xkcd.com/1425/), because it's very easy to get _so_ enamored with the idea that everything in the way suddenly seems deceptively insignificant.

But don't lose hope!

Depending on the game, you may not even have to get into programming to have a playable prototype. You can write the rules and follow them, right? If yes, try simulating the game on the table first. If not, hold your horses and learn to do that first!

If your type of game doesn't work so well as a tabletop (although a few trial runs may still be beneficial) or you're happy enough with it as a tabletop to make it real, then it's time to pick a tool. 

### Job / money

## <s>Rant</s> Philosophical answer

You need to understand the practical benefits of what you're doing. Because you're investing time into it, and you have a finite amount of time on your hands. You should expect some <abbr title="Return on Time Investment">ROTI</abbr>.

If you're not expecting any *specific* returns, there is a very fair chance that you'll get _nothing in return_. Why bother then?

But there is, of course, *a catch*. Being uninformed and being aware of it.
