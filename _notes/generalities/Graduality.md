title: Graduality principle
---

The assertion that every process is gradual on some level.

It's a solid heuristic to deny most ideologies solely on a basis that they don't define "how do we get there" or define it with so many free variables that it becomes very unlikely that their desirable state will ever be reached.

It is also a simple notion that can be used to get back to reality from too large-scale ideas, be it existential concerns, planetwide events or any other events that you have no significant influence over and thus shouldn't feel guilty about. ⚠ That's not to say you shouldn't be "looking up" at all, but your association with "what you see" should be decreasing the higher you look — and you still can "climb higher" yourself.
