Grepping, named after [the famous `grep` utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep), is a slang for "selecting results matching something"

Here's a quick example of `grep` itself:

```sh
$ cat sample.txt      # 01 02 10 20
$ grep 1 sample.txt   # 01    10
```

A particularly common form is "visual grepping", which refers to grepping _with your naked eyes_. This term can be seen in discussions around UI design, especially among developers.
