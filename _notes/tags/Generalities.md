Guidelines that I have ascertained over countless occasions and that I frequently use in my decision-making process. Somewhat philosophical, but still practical.

They are by nature very broad and vague as they are only meant to steer the decision-making process a certain way. [Heuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic), if you will.

I use them as a substitute for deeper analysis in situations where it cannot be otherwise performed (e. g. due to lack of time or reliable information) and most of the time they work out alright.
