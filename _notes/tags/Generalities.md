ðŸš® This page **previously** documented a bunch of philosophical principles I often use. I have now removed them aa obsolete.

I've since found a much more useful source of writeups on these subjects: [RationalWiki](https://rationalwiki.org/), that not only document what I had here in more detail and provide examples, but also indicate when these "rules of thumb" can be *wrong* â€” something I did not go into much detail about, but still very important.

Pages I particularly recommend:

* [**Golden Rule**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) about doing unto others
* [**Informal fallacy** / \*](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy "Informal fallacy")
* [**False dilemma** / Assuming mutual exclusion](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/False_dilemma#Assuming_mutual_exclusion)
* [**Myrphy's Law**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_Law), specifically pertaining to human error by individuals and companies
* [**Nirvana fallacy**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy), also known as perfectionism
* [**Emotional intelligence**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence) which may be a misnomer for what it defines

The point of this list is to replace a bunch of pages previously present here. They have a lot of stuff worth reading. If you've seen something philosophical here before and it's no longer here, chances are one of these pages has it. And probably in much more detail I could possibly be bothered to write down.
