## Software

I'm a long-time Linux user. But after 2020, as <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr>2 matured, I finally decided to switch to Windows 10. Primary reason for this being second-class vendor support, in both software and hardware. Which I find to be a rather sad state of affairs.

I do still use Linux at home for [[self-hosting|hosting my "cloud services"]], since that's the area where I believe Linux still shines. And the software I work on usually runs in Linux, and as such a lot of tooling that I use is Linux-based.

* [[KeePass]] has become my go-to solution for credential management. See [[KeePass|the respective page]] for more details.

*[[TOPUBLISH]] dotfiles*

## Hardware

I have two primary PCs at home: for work and for personal use. But I have both attached to the same desk and to the same peripherals.
