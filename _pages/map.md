ðŸ’¡ You can use the search function of your browser to search for specific keywords on the map. Though the search will (probably?) be unable to pan the map towards the result, so you might have to zoom out to see it.

Also, every note has a **ðŸ—º Find on the map** link at the end that opens the surroundings of that note on the map.
